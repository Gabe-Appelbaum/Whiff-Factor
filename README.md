# Whiff-Factor

Whiff factor is a model which quantifies all MLB and AAA parks' effect on whiff rates. A whiff factor of 100 is average, above 100 is an increase in whiffs, and below 100 is a decrease in whiffs. The difference from 100 to the whiff factor itself is the log odds effect that stadium term has on whiff rate. So for example a whiff factor of 110 means that stadium term has a log odds effect of 0.1. I say stadium term because whiff factor seperates day and night games and also accounts for stadiums with retractable roofs.

Whiff factor was presented at Saber Seminar 2025. The slides from that presentation are available here.
